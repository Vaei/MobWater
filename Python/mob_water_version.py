"""Stamps every generated asset with the plugin version that built it, and checks the stamp.

A generated asset is a build output that lives in source control, so nothing about it says which
generator produced it. Content built by one version and shipped beside another reads as a tuning
problem rather than as stale content, and that is the failure this exists to name.

The stamp is package metadata: no node in the graph, no cost at run time, and stripped on cook.

Two values, because they answer different questions.

- The plugin version is what shipped. It is compared against CONTENT_VERSION, the last version whose
  generated output actually had to change, so a patch release that touched no generator does not
  report every asset stale.
- The generator digest covers the scripts that decide what an asset contains. It moves the moment
  they do, which is the in-development drift a version number cannot see, so it is reported as a
  warning rather than a failure.
